    # should be loaded from stage-specific YAML files (stage1_params.yaml, stage2_params.yaml, etc.)
    # This file only contains default robot control and environment parameters.

    speed_step: 1.0 # Time to wait in the reset phases

    linear_forward_speed: 0.15 # Speed for going forwards

    init_linear_turn_speed: 0.0 # Initial angular speed in which we start each episode

    new_ranges: 30 # How many laser readings we jump in each observation reading (default value, override in stage configs)
    min_range: 0.13 # Minimum meters below which we consider we have crashed
    max_laser_value: 6 # Value considered Ok, no wall
    min_laser_value: 0 # Value considered there is an obstacle or crashed

    # Reward System (weighted obstacle penalty format)
    # Terminal rewards are hardcoded in _compute_reward():
    #   - Success (goal reached): +200
    #   - Failure (collision/timeout): -100
    # Step rewards computed dynamically:
    #   - Yaw alignment reward: 1.0 - (2.0 * |goal_angle| / pi)
    #   - Obstacle penalty: weighted by direction and proximity (front obstacles penalized 10x more)
    #   - Danger zone: 0.5m, Safety margin: 0.2m
